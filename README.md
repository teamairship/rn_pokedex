# Unosquare | React Native Pok√©dex

## Getting Started
Before the tech interview, be sure to go through and get the project setup and running on your machine. Reach out if you run into any issues!

### Setup
Ensure you have your environment setup correctly for either using iOS or Android. This project uses the ***React Native CLI*** and not metro.

Once you have your environment setup and you have the project cloned to your machine, go ahead and install the packages with `yarn`. We have a `postinstall` script that will install pods for iOS and run jetify for Android.

### Run the app
iOS:
```
yarn ios
```

Android:
```
yarn android
```
